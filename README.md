- 👋 Hi, I’m @oelakad
- 👀 I’m interested in using bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize new targets against diseases. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning analysis of Multi-omics data (correlation between Mass Spectrometry, Mutations, RNAsequencing and supplementary information).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects including basic/downstream analysis and/or graphical representation of biological datasets. 
- 📫 you can reach me at omarakkad14@gmail.com
